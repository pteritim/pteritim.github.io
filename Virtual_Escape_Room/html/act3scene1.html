    <div class="bodytext">
      You emerge into the cool mountain air, the serenity of your surroundings at war with your roiling emotions. Your body is in a primal state of panic, and your surroundings rush past in a blur as you flee down the mountainside.
As the snow-covered trees and rocks flash by, the edges of your vision gradually darken, as if night were already falling. An impossibility, as it has been only a few hours since sunrise. A terrible realisation hits you: the vvitch is already exerting its powers on you, and you are being fed hallucinations.
Determined to escape, you command your legs to run faster. However, as you glance down, you realise with sinking dismay that they are rooted to the spot. A strangely familiar sickly sweet smell fills your nose. Looking back up, your surroundings have changed. As if sucked into an old television set, your world is now in black and white. Where once stood proud trunks of pine, now stands a scene of a crowded street from the 1930s. You have to break out of the hallucination, but how?
