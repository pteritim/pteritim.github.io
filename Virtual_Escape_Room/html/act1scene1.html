      The taxi driver had been prattling on unceasingly throughout the ride, with the subject matter of his anecdotes becoming increasingly and disquietingly personal and disturbing. Thankfully, the ride was about to come to an end, and it’s with a great sigh of relief that you spot the sign “Dyatlov Pass Campsite Carpark”.

      Collecting your belongings, you step out of the cab into the bracing mountain air. The taxi executes a perfectly clumsy 3-point-turn, and speeds off into the night. As the muted red of the car’s taillights fade into distance, you can’t help but envision them as a pair of watchful eyes disappearing into the night. All of a sudden, the chilling cold and heavy darkness of your surroundings hits you, and you suppress a quiet shiver.

As you put your phone away, the first rays of dawn comes streaming over the Ural peaks. The sunlight feels like a cherub’s kiss on your cold cheeks, and with newfound energy you set about finding your friends.
