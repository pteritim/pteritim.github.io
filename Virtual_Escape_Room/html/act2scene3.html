      As you exit the narrow tunnel, your vision is abruptly flooded by the incandescence of hundreds of amber flames. The ovals of orange warmth line the floor, walls and ceiling of the igloo, glowing quietly like fireflies on a warm summer night. As your brain grapples with the impossibility of the previously unseen illumination, the soft warmth of the candlelight jarringly juxtaposes with the scene before you. In the centre of the igloo lies the pale carcass of one of your beloved friends. The mangled flesh betrays no identity of its past owner: the head is completely missing, with huge chunks rent from the torso. Jagged ribs jut outwards like crumbling ivory towers. Bite marks dot the mottled skin; the jaw shape is almost human, and yet not quite.

      Juxtaposed with the lifeless lumps of flesh, the perpetrator sits nearby, brimming with a quiet vitality. Its posture flawlessly erect, a humanoid creature sits in eerie silence at the far end of the room. Gnarly, knobbly fingers sit curled meditatively in its lap. Its pale, bony legs are crossed, with ankles ending not in feet but polished cloven hooves. Its skin is plastered with mythic runes, carved in jagged lines of ivory scar or pink wound. Completely hairless, its head is instead crowned with spiralling, beastly horns. While seemingly devoid of musculature, the creature somehow emanates an aura of brutal power. Its mouth is a Picasso of angular teeth arranged in a rough spiral, and fresh blood oozes from numberless small cuts around its lips. Its eye sockets are pitch-black, and as your gaze connects with the creature’s, your mind’s eye is suddenly filled with a vision. The vision reveals much about the creature: it is a vvitch, a powerful demonic sorcerer that uses dark magic to influence and muddle the minds of its victims. During the day, its power is limited, and it rests. However, once the sun sets, its powers are fully realised. The vision ends as abruptly as it began, its source an insoluble mystery. Yet you are thankful for the information, as it has given you a clear objective:
