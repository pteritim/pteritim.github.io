      With trepid steps, you quake and tremble your way into a dense, snow-covered thicket. Each step brings you closer to danger, and your racing pulse lurches ever quicker with each passing minute. Every instinct in you is screaming for you to run, and you fight with every ounce of your willpower to dismiss these urges.

        Picturing their smiling faces in your mind’s eye, you feel a fresh surge of courage fill your shaking limbs. You plunge further into the woods, the flame of fraternity in your heart blazing against the blustery winds of fear. Pushing a snow-laden branch out of the way, a clearing appears before you. As the pristine snow falls peacefully to the ground, your heart leaps in your chest. In the centre of a rough circle of mossy gravel stands an igloo of obsidian rocks. The rough, jagged external walls are blacker than any stone you’ve ever seen, and the yawning mouth of the igloo blazes darker still. The structure seems both crude and deliberate simultaneously, as if there were a measured chaos about its construction. Responsible for the unease in your heart is the dense atmosphere of dread gripping the entire clearing. A sickly-sweet stench permeates the thin mountain air, adding nausea to your list of unbearable feelings. Mustering every last iota of courage you can, you grit your teeth and crawl through the mouth of the igloo.
