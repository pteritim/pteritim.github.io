      The Airbus A350-900 is a technological wonder. With a fuselage made of carbon-fibre reinforced plastic, it can accommodate up to 350 passengers for flights up to 15,000km in length. As a member of the Dean’s List of your aerospace engineering course, you can appreciate the expertise and skill that goes into keeping these 200-tonne behemoths in the air. On a normal day, your heart would be full of wonder, marvelling at the majestic metal beasts cruising through the skies. But today is not a normal day: today is the day you are meeting your coursemates for a camping expedition in the <span id="ural">Ural Mountains</span>. You had eagerly anticipated this day for a whole semester, but as it finally arrives, all you can muster is dull disappointment.

 So, as fate would have it, today has turned out not to be the day you are meeting your coursemates. Thankfully, there’s another flight this evening, leaving you just enough time to catch up with your friends at their first campsite.
“Igor and the gang will spend the whole of Thursday trekking up to Dyatlov Pass. Thankfully, I can take a taxi up to the campsite during the night and meet them there on Friday morning.”
Despite their protests, you would never allow them to delay their trip just to wait a whole day for you. With the plan settled with the hike leader, all that’s left is to set your alarm for tonight’s flight…
