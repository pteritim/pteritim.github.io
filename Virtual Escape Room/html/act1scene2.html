      The creek ran red. The soft, gentle trickle of glacial water starkly juxtaposed its maroon hue, and all the implications that carried. Your chest tightened as your pace quickened, rushing, tripping, down the trail littered with scattered and torn pieces of clothing and hiking equipment that led to the main campsite. Tents, torn, ripped. Snow, spotted sanguine. And the bodies. No, the corpses.
      <br><br>

      Suppressing both tears and vomit, you struggle to make sense of what your eyes are showing you. Clothing and equipment dotted the campsite, as if haphazardly discarded by a violent whirlwind. Tents sagged flaccidly under the weight of the soft morning snow, as tent poles lay strewn in cleanly snapped pieces.
      <br><br>
      Yuri’s body; no, Yuri’s corpse lay naked in the middle of an empty firepit, prostrate on the grey stone with palms upturned, as if imploring the heavens for an explanation for this ungodly scene.
      <br><br>
      Igor lay just metres away, almost equally undressed, his glazed-over icy blue eyes glaring piercingly into yours, chilling you almost as much as the sub-zero weather.
      <br><br>
      Nikolai’s corpse lay in the creek, a seemingly unending stream of blood flowing from a gaping hole in his skull into the gentle waters. Nikolai’s bloated and swollen eyeballs hung limply against his cheeks by pale white optic nerves. His normally handsome, sea-green irises glare accusingly at you: why weren’t you here, Kate?
      <br><br>
      “I’m sorry”, you thought weakly, as hazy darkness clouded your vision, and you slumped to the ground in a puddle of grief.
