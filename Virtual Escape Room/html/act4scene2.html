    <div class="bodytext">
      The snowmobile’s engine coughs into life. The unsteady hacking turns into a guttural growl: the beast is raring to go. Brimming with optimistic confidence, your escape is all but certain now. As you set off down the snowmobile trail, stirrings of hope swell in your traumatised heart. Just then, your vision shoots to black. Equally suddenly, your mind is filled with a kaleidoscope of swirling colours: burning whites, iridescent blues, shimmering purples, brooding umbers, sparkling yellows, glowing oranges, passionate reds. The orchestra of hues quickly turns into a cacophony, bombarding your senses with visual overload. Then the screams begin.

      Guttural howls, banshee wails, murderous yells, menacing taunts; you realise instinctively: these are the crazed ramblings of the vvitch’s previous victims. You shudder as you feel ice-cold tendrils creep across your skin. The fingers of the grim reaper rake through your hair and crawl across your torso, tickling down your back and grasping your limbs in a vice. The same sickly sweet smell overwhelms your nose, becoming so powerful it’s nauseating and leaves you dry-heaving. The relentless assault on your senses leaves you gasping for respite. However, one rational thought shines through the madness: the vvitch knows I am almost free. This is its last-ditch attempt to subdue me. I just need to overcome this one last hurdle.
  As if it had sensed your thoughts, the sensational assault abruptly ceases. Replacing the screams is a maniacal laughter, as the vvitch itself appears before you. Its pitch-black eyes stare piercingly into your soul, leaving you feeling sickened and violated.
