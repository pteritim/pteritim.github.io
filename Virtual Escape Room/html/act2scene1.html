    <div class="note">
      Kate, if you’re reading this, run. There’s something terrible happening here. Something almost supernatural. I can’t explain it. It seems like everyone is going slowly mad. Alexander started raving about demons and witches, then bolted away from the campsite into the blizzard. We’ve no clue what happened to him. I keep seeing things that are there one moment, then gone the next. terrible visions of scowling wolves and rabid dogs. Yuri is growing demonic horns from his eyes, and needs to take them out. the tent poles are conducting the demonic energies they must be destroyed. hot so hot. too hot for these furs the furs are screaming at me i see the animals dying they didn’t want to become coats must avenge the animals the coats are evil all around me demons see through their lies won’t escape me all the demons must burn i am become death the destroyer

      The note’s abrupt ending was almost as jarring as its contents. Igor, the most level-headed and rational person you had ever met, had clearly gone insane. The chaos of the campsite, which you had initially presumed to have been caused by some violent external force, had apparently been perpetrated by the campers themselves. Driven mad by delusions, they had turned on their equipment and each other. The only feeling stronger than the anxious bewilderment in the pit of your stomach is the chilling questioning as to whether anyone had survived this horrific spate of events. At this moment, two things catch your eye: cautiously peeking out of a nearby backpack is the chrome yellow of a satellite phone, and at the snow-hazed periphery of the campsite, a trail of crusted blood leads into the distance.
      <br><br>
      In the remoteness of the Ural Mountains, a satellite phone is your only chance of contacting the authorities for help. On the other hand, the trail of blood could lead to one of your friends, battered but potentially still very much alive.

      <div class="puzzletext">
        You have two options: proceed immediately to follow the blood trail and forego calling for help, or spend precious time phoning for help while your friend might be facing danger. Which will you choose?

        <div class="choice" id="choice">
          Before starting to follow the blood trail, it occurs to you that some protection or equipment might be a good idea to help you face the uncertain threat ahead. Casting your gaze around the campsite, you spot two potentially useful items: a mallet and a flashlight. However, your backpack only has space for one item. Pressed for time, you hastily select one of the two tools and begin to follow the trail of blood.

          As soon as you unlock the satellite phone, the battery immediately dies. Stifling a frustrated yell, all that's left is to follow the trail of blood. Before setting off, it occurs to you that some protection or equipment might be a good idea to help you face the uncertain threat ahead. Casting your gaze around the campsite, you spot two potentially useful items: a mallet and a flashlight. However, your backpack only has space for one item.
